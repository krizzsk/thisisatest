Requirement is a rule defined for a project or a product.

In most IT projects, requirement can be a functional rule for a software.

It allows to define and monitor cost and delays.

It can be linked to test cases, it's used to describe how you will test that a given requirement.

.. rubric:: Rights management

Linking requirements to a project will limit the visibility, respecting rights management at project level.

.. rubric:: Requirement link to test cases


Test cases can be linked to a requirement in **List of test cases**.

Linking a requirement to a test case will display a summary of test case run (defined in test session). This way, you will have an instant display of test coverage for the requirement.

.. _summary-test-case-run-status:
      
This section summarizes the status of test case runs to requirement and test session.

   
   * |Planned| **Planned:** No test failed or blocked, at least one test planned.
   * |Passed| **Passed:** All tests passed.
   * |Failed| **Failed:** At least one test failed.
   * |Blocked| **Blocked:** No test failed, at least one test blocked.
   
   
   
   
 .. compound:: Requirement

   Summarizes the status of test case runs for test cases are linked to the requirement.

   Because a test case can be linked to several test sessions, total can be greater than linked to the requirement.
   



 .. compound:: Test session

   Summarizes the status of test case runs in the test session.





.. rubric:: Requirement link to tickets

* When test case run status is set to **failed**, the reference to a ticket must be defined (reference to the incident).
* When the requirement is linked to a test case with this run status, ticket is automatically linked to the requirement. 

.. rubric:: Predecessor and successor elements

* Requirements can have predecessors and successors.
* This defines some dependencies on the requirements.
* The dependencies don’t have specific effects. It is just an information.

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

Possibility to define :ref:`indicators<indicator>` to follow the respect of dates values.

   * Respect of validated end date
   * Respect of planned end date
   * Respect of requested start date

Test cases are elementary actions executed to test a requirement.

You may define several tests to check a requirement, or check several requirements with one test.

The test case is defined for a project, a product or one these components.
