Planning
********

The Gantt chart is a tool used in scheduling and project management and allowing to visualize in time the various tasks composing a project.

It is a representation of a connected graph, evaluated and oriented, which makes it possible to graphically represent the progress of the project.

.. note:: For large projects, with many sub-projects and activities, we limit the number of lines to display so as not to deteriorate performance, even if the project selector has already contextualized the display

.. _Gantt_chart:

Gantt chart
-----------

This screen allows to define projects planning and follow progress.

**The Gantt Chart is composed of five areas:**

.. _ActivityPlanningCalculation:

.. rubric:: |oneBLC| Activity planning calculation

When you make a modification on an element of your project, the project must then be recalculated to take it into account.

You have the option of using the automatic calculation function, which, if you make a modification on the planning screen, and only on this screen, will immediately take this modification into account.

If the modification is made on another screen, even if you have selected automatic calculation then, you will have to restart the calculation on the planning screen.



* Click on |Plan| to start the activity planning calculation.

* A popup window appears with the list of projects. 

* The check boxes allow you to select one or more projects to recalculate.



.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_Calculation.png
   :alt: Project selection popUp for project calculation
   
   Project selection popUp for project calculation 


If you have selected one or more projects with :ref:`Project Selector<project-selector>` then the selected projects will be automatically checked.
   
Choose the date on which you want to recalculate the project.  

By checking the "Hide unselected projects" box, you will only have the projects selected in the project selector and they will be automatically checked.

:ref:`[back]<Toolbar-Gantt>`



.. index:: Overuse

.. _overuse-calculation:


 .. compound:: Overuse (infinite overbooking capacity)
  
   The overuse option allows you to allocate to all the resources and this, on the projects of your choice, maximum overbooking.

   This allows you to see the amount of work that is overused for the resources assigned to the task for each period of time.

   .. warning::

      This function is dangerous, it does not reflect reality.
   
      For this reason, by default, it is not activated, even for the administrator.

      See: :ref:`specific_access` in the Planning section access rights



   The overuse option allows you to allocate to all the resources and this, on the projects of your choice, maximum overbooking.


:ref:`[back]<Toolbar-Gantt>`





.. _auto-run:

.. rubric:: |twoBLC| Automatic run plan

Swith the button to activate automatic calculation on each change.
  
Only works on the Gantt Planning view. 

If the modification of an element is carried out on the dedicated screen of the element, then it is necessary to click again on BUTTON to restart the computation

All modifications about assignement (rate, name or numbers of resources, dates...) done are not displayed on the new planning screen until having, for this purpose, activited the planning calculation, either in an automatic run plan or not.
  
On the contrary, the screen planning will not change even if modifications have been loaded yet.

 .. compound:: Automatic calculation

  **Differential calculation =** calculation of projects that require a recalculation.
  
  **Complete calculation =** calculation of all projects

  
  The calculations are programmed according to a frequency of CRON type (every minute, every hour, at a given hour every day, at a given time on a given week day, ...)
  
  See: Global Parameters into the chapter :ref:`Automatic planning Calculation<automatic-planning-calcul>`


:ref:`[back]<Toolbar-Gantt>`

.. _critical-path:

  .. compound:: Critical path

      **The critical path** allows you to determine the total duration of your project. This is the longest sequence of tasks that must be completed for the project to be completed on time.
      
      **The Critical Chain**, meanwhile, is a technique for planning and monitoring deadlines but has the same principle: take into account the constraints to determine the duration of the project and the critical tasks that may impact this duration.
      One of these constraints is the taking into account of resource or skill limitations in addition to the dependencies between the tasks and the implementation of buffers, i.e. time reserves, in the critical chain and the secondary chains.
      
      ProjeQtOr offers you a critical chain rather than a critical path, but for better understanding, the term Critical path has been retained.
      
      * click on the **critical path** check box to calculate and display the red path in the Gantt schedule.
      
      .. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_CriticalPath.png
         :alt: Critical Path
         :align: center
         
         The red net represents the critical path of the project. 
      
      .. note::
         
         The tasks of the project which are not crossed by the critical path are elements which will not affect the duration of the project and, even modified, will not automatically involve a modification of this duration for the entire project.

:ref:`[back]<Toolbar-Gantt>`


  .. compound:: Project model

      You can display or hide the template type projects in the area list.

Dependencies allow to define the execution order of tasks (sequential or concurrent).

All planning elements can be linked to others.

Dependencies can be managed in the Gantt chart and in screen of planning element.

Dependencies between planning elements are displayed with an arrow.


 .. compound:: Create a dependency

   To create a dependency, left click on a bar of the gantt (the predecessor) and slide towards the successor.
   
   You can also create dependencies with the predecessor and successor tables at the bottom of the details area. 
   
   Remember than the first task always drives the second.

 .. compound:: Dependency types

  .. compound:: |DependancyES| End-Start 
  
    The second activity can not start before the end of the first activity.

  .. compound:: |DependancySS| Start-Start
  
    The successor can not begin before the beginning of the predecessor. Anyway, the successor can begin after the beginning of the predecessor.

  .. compound:: |DependancyEE| End-End
  
    The successor should not end after the end of the predecessor, which leads to planning "as late as possible". 
    
    Anyway, the successor can end before the predecessor. Note that the successor "should" not end after the end of predecessor, but in some cases this will not be respected:
    
    * if the resource is already 100% used until the end of the successor
    * if the successor has another predecessor of type "End-Start" or "Start-Start" and the remaining time is not enough to complete the task
    * if the delay from the planning start date does not allow to complete the task
 


 .. compound:: Strict mode for dependencies
   
   The strict dependency mode forces the successor planning element not to start on the same day as the same predecessor but the next day. Even if the task is finished before the end of the day.

   To have the successor start on the same day or before the end of the predecessor task, select NO for strict mode or you can also put a negative delay.

   The strict dependency mode is a :ref:`global parameter<gp_planning-section>`.

   By default, the strict dependency mode is set to YES.

.. index:: Planning order

.. _planning-order:

Planning order
--------------

The planning is calculated as simply as possible. This means that no complex algorithm is applied. 

The principle adopted is simply to be able to reproduce what you could do with a spreadsheet type spreadsheet, but this time automatically.

All unrealized work is planned, from the start date to the maximum date depending on the load assigned to the project(s).

.. rubric:: The calculations are performed task by task, according to the following organization

* **WBS**

  The WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), that is to say the structure or scheduling of your schedule is planned first if no other constraint comes to disturb this order. It is read from top to bottom and from left to right.

* **The validated end date**

  It is possible to set the default priority of activities from the finish date posted before the order in the WBS structure.
  
     - This will give higher priority to activities that need to finish sooner, regardless of WBS.
     - The planned end date is by default the validated end date.
     - If the validated end date is not defined, the planned end date can be retrieved from a successor (e.g. end milestone) or from the parent.
     - If two activities have the same scheduled end date, the WBS is always the last priority criterion.
     - This feature can be disabled in Global setting to fetch default WBS criteria only.

* **Priorities of activities**

  All activities with the lowest priority value will potentially be scheduled first.

* **Project priorities**

  The smallest value (index) is calculated first, this means in particular that if the projects have different priorities, all activities of the project with the smallest priority value will potentially be planned first.

* **Planning modes**

  "The must start on the validated date", "regular between two dates" and "recurring" modes are priority modes compared to the other activity planning modes other than manual planning.

* **Dependencies**

  If an activity or project has a predecessor, the predecessor is always scheduled first.

* **Meetings**

  It is fixed on a given date. Even if not all of the participants are available. In this case, an alert informs you and the Gantt chart displays the unavailability.

* **Planning Manual** and planned interventions

  This highest priority planning mode. The workload assigned with this planning mode can be recorded in planned work or in actual work.


.. _planningmodeGantt:

Planning Modes
--------------

Projeqtor offers several ways to plan the workload for your resource with 11 different planning modes.

The order of the planning modes is not random and the further you go down the list, the more the planning modes have priority and will recover the load on the tasks that can be scheduled in the previous planning modes.

.. _mode-assoon:

.. rubric:: As soon as possible

* The task is planned to be completed as quickly as possible.

* If no assignment is created the bar will automatically be 1 day.

* If the validated duration is entered, it is this duration that is planned.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 




.. _mode-worktogether:

.. rubric:: Work together

* When two or more resources are assigned to the same task, planning tries to find periods where all resources are available to work together.

* Periods are searched "as soon as possible".

* If only one resource is assigned, this planning mode is exactly the same as "As soon as possible".

* If one resource is assigned more work than the other, the extra work is planned after working together periods.

.. _mode-fixedduration:

.. rubric:: Fixed duration

* The task is planned by duration. The validated duration field must be filled in.

* If work is assigned to the task, the scheduling behavior is the same as "Regular Between Dates".

* Ability to readjust (start and end date) the task with handles directly on the Gantt view bar.

* When the number of assigned work days exceeds the indicated duration, then the days (detail of the Gantt bars) following the validated end date of the activity will be in red.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 



.. _mode-durationdriven:

.. rubric:: Duration driven

* The task is planned by duration which is fixed.

* If the allocation of resources exceeds the set validated duration then the distribution of remaining work becomes overuse.

* When the assigned workload does not exceed the number of days of fixed duration then the planning mode distributes the workload by smoothing it throughout the duration, exactly as with the fixed duration or the regular between two dates.

* In automatic calculation mode, only the activity in this mode will be recalculated. 

* Other activities, even those driven by dependencies, will only be recalculated with the full calculation function.

* Ability to readjust and move the task (handles on each side of the bar) directly on the Gantt.

* With the left handle you adjust the full bar without changing the duration.

.. _mode-startbefore:

.. rubric:: Must not start before validated start date

* The validated start date field must be set.

* The task must not begin before a specific date.

* If a stronger constraint, such as dependencies or real work, is specified, the planning mode will no longer be respected.

* You can block resource imputations in this planning mode by enabling the global parameters "lock timesheet before validated start date" in :ref:`global settings<realWorkAllocation-section>`
  

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>`  


.. _mode-startat:

.. rubric:: Must start at validated start date

* The validated start date field must be set.

* The task must not begin before this specific date.

* This planning mode reclaims time from previous planning modes. 

* It has priority over the "as soon as possible", "fixed duration" and "work together" modes.

* The start date is no longer respected if a stronger constraint, such as dependencies or real work, is specified.

You can block resource imputations in this planning mode by enabling the global parameters "lock timesheet before validated start date" in :ref:`global settings<realWorkAllocation-section>`

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 






.. _mode-regularExcess:

 .. compound:: Regular modes with excess workload

    If the dates are too short compared to the assigned load, the excess load will be divided and added in the same way as the chosen mode.
    
    So you can get full days even in regular mode in quarter day or half days.
    
      * Example with 8 days of workload to plan over 10 days with the Regular mode in half days between dates 
    
      .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_RegularHalf.png
         :alt: Regular in half day with excess workload
         
         
    The load is distributed regularly so as to respect the dates.


      .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_RegularExcess.png

    If the load is too high to meet the dates, the excess load will be distributed over the whole day after the validated end date and will therefore be late (red color)

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 


.. _mode-recurring:

.. rubric:: Recurring (on a weekly basis)
  
* This mode allows you to plan the workload on a weekly basis which will be distributed each week, for example 1/2 day every Monday, 1 hour every day, etc.

* It automatically adapts to the elements which determines the total duration of the project. If the project falls behind schedule, this mode will continue to adapt and automatically distribute the load for each added day.

.. tip:: Please note, the project is only an envelope, it is the elements that compose it which will determine its duration. 
   A recurring activity cannot be calculated correctly if it is the only component of the project, even if it has validated dates. 
   Other elements (Activities, milestones, etc.) will be needed for the distribution of this load to be done correctly.
   

Click |edit| to enter the load for each day of the week.

The work is distributed dynamically according to the load indicated on the assignment table.

.. _mode-manualplanning:

.. rubric:: Manual planning

* This is the most priority planning mode and constraint.

* You have the option to save the work as planned or real work. 

* Two screens are dedicated to it: :ref:`planned interventions<planned-interventions>` to plan monthly and the :ref:`View interventions<view-interventions>` for read-only.

.. note::

   The choice of planned or actual work is made in the global parameters in the planning section work tab.

   See: :ref:`global parameters<GP-effectCapacity>`.

:ref:`|MODES|<planningmodeGantt>` 


.. _minimumthreshold:

.. rubric:: Minimum threshold & not splitted work
   
When this value is set, the activity will only be scheduled on the day when the daily availability is greater than or equal to this threshold.

You also have the option to add a new property to a “cannot be split” task.

This will require defining the minimum work to be allocated each day and therefore filling in the minimum threshold field.

Be careful with this mode, planning will require finding consecutive days with at least the given value possible, which may never happen.





.. _plan-overuse:

Plan with overuse
-----------------

Scheduling with overuse calculates the schedule with "infinite" capacity for each resource.

It is assumed that the resource (ETP=1) can be planned on each project with its maximum ETP.

For example, if the resource is on 5 projects then it will be scheduled up to 5 fte per day.

.. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_WithoutOverusePlan.png
   
If we recalculate with infinite capacity this is what the schedule says.

.. _critical-resource:

Critical resource
-----------------
The critical resources screen will allow you to identify the resources that will cause the project to drift and not miss certain key dates due to lack of capacity on the project.

This amounts to calculating the complete schedule and all your resources in infinite overbooking mode.

The critical resources table tells you for each critical resource displayed

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_TableCriticalResource.png
   :alt: Critical resources list
   
   Critical resources list
   
   
* The name of the resource
* Its charges available
* Its load used
* Overbooking charge
* Its rank (Index used to calculate the margin = difference between available - used)

This table of critical resources is broken down by project.

.. rubric:: Projects using critical resources

The Projects using critical resources table allows you to visualize the number of days late per project and which resources are causing the delay.

The strategic value has no impact on the display of projects and the determination of critical resources. This (numerical) value is free and left to your discretion. 

It can be a value between 1 and 100, or a number of Business, regardless, this will allow you to identify whether projects consuming critical resources are strategically sound and therefore worth implementing.
   
   
.. rubric:: The Critical resources planning

The **Critical resources list by period** table is a representation of the current planning, not the ideal planning.

The display will be done by period defined on the scale (week, month, quarter) or by displaying the "overbooking load" necessary to optimize the planning.

.. rubric:: Formatting results and indicators

Indicator is a percentage  = (Margin - Subooked) / Available (* 100)

* Define threshold 
   - Defaut Red = "< 20%"
   - Default Orange = "< 5%"    
   
   
* Late planning
   - In red, the resource does not have sufficient capacity to complete the task on time
   -  planned end date > Validated end date - overbooking on the activity

* Missing capacity
   - In yellow, the resource does not have sufficient capacity to complete the task on time but is not the cause of the task delay.
   - Planned end date > Validated end date - no overbooking

* Optimal planning 
   - In green, the resource has sufficient capacity to complete the task on time
   - Planned end date < Validated end date - no overbooking on the activity

   The selected parameters, except the month, always set by default to the current month, are saved as a user parameter. 

   When the user returns to the screen, he therefore finds the last parameters entered   
   
   
.. _manualPlan-ListProjectActivity:

.. rubric:: |twoBLC| List of Projects and activity    
   
The list of activities displayed are in the planning mode "manual planning". If no filter is selected (project, resource, organization ...) then the screen does not display any data.

You cannot create new activities in manual planning mode from the intervention screen. You need to access the activities or schedule screen to create the new activity in manual planning mode. The new activity will then appear in the list.

Click on |Goto| to access the activity screen and view its detail 
 



   .. _manuelPlan-fte:

.. rubric:: |threeBLC| FTE    
   
In this calendar, we display graphically if we respect the quantity of people requested on the activity and on the half day.

Fill in an integer value for each activity to check.

If you enter 1, you expect at least one person to perform half a day on this activity.

A check is then carried out and takes into account all the resources assigned to each activity, and not only those selected and visible on the calendar.

If the field is left empty or at 0 then no control is carried out and the calendar will not display any green or red box.

 .. compound:: Blue box
 
   When you start to put in the workload but do not yet reach all of the expected FTEs.
   
   .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_FTEBlue.png
   
   

 .. compound:: Green Box
 
   If the entry respects the workload constraint expected in FTE the box is green.

   .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_FTEGreen.png
   
   Example with a value of 2 in the FTE field for the selected activity.
   
   This FTE value is defined for each half-day.

   You must therefore have 2 effective persons planned for each half day whatever the resource or resources that will be provided.
   
   
   
 .. compound:: Red Box
 
  If the total entry is greater than the expected workload in FTE the box is red.
   
  .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_FTERed.png
   
  The box then turns red: the workload is higher than expected since we expected a person on this half day and on this activity   
   
   
 .. compound:: Non-colored box
 
   There is no expected workload.   

.. _manualPlan-InterventionMode:

.. rubric:: |fourBLC| Interventions mode

The list of possible intervention methods is customizable.

This list can be modified via a setting screen in the :ref:`list of values<intervention-mode-value>`.

The saved modes will remain fixed for all projects and all teams.

   Intervention mode

You can select an activity or a modality or both.

     * If the intervention mode is not selected, the box is colored according to the activity but no letter appears, and vice versa.

     * If only the intervention mode is selected, it will be saved without modifying the planned or actual work.

You can however add one or the other after having planned the intervention or the intervention mode.

A second click with the same parameters will delete the assignment.

Ctrl Click allows you to complete the two half days



.. _manualPlan-InterventionIntervention:

.. rubric:: |fiveBLC| Interventions Calendar


* Click on an activity and / or an intervention modes to plan workload on it

* Click on half a day to plan the workload
      
* The targeted half day is filled with the color of the selected activity and the letter of the chosen intervention mode.

   
 .. compound:: Light Gray color

   The light gray box indicates that the day is inactive on the resource calendar.

   It can correspond to a weekend, a public holiday or a non-working day recorded on the resource's calendar.
 
   .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_PLannedInterventionCalendar.png



 .. compound:: Dark Gray color
 
   The dark gray boxes indicate reality. It's work actually performed and informed on the timesheet.
   
   When real work is completed for half a day, the box is half gray.

   If the full day is completed then the box is completely grayed out.
   
   .. image:: /images/GUI/GANTT_ZONE_PLannedInterventionReal.png
